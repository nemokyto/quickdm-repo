Quick Dungeon Master (QuickDM for short) is a website that allows you to take simple notes for everything running up in your sessions.

QuickDM offers various features for Dungeon Masters, such as:
* A textbox for making notes;
* A menu with numerous dices for rolling your dice;
* A calculator and a simple turn counter;
* A customizable "health bar" for your boss battles.

QuickDM is a simple and fast solution that offers a customizable environment for busy DMs, and will soon be hosted on GitHub Pages!
